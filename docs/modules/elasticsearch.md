# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

The following example uses the following NuGet packages:

<!--codeinclude-->
[Dependencies](../../tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests.csproj) inside_block:Dependencies
<!--/codeinclude-->

IDEs and editors may also require the following packages to run tests: `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`.

Copy and paste the following code into a new `.cs` test file within an existing test project.

<!--codeinclude-->
[Elasticsearch Example](../../tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests/ElasticsearchContainerTest.cs) inside_block:Elasticsearch
<!--/codeinclude-->

To execute the tests, use the command `dotnet test` from a terminal.

## A Note To Developers

The Testcontainers module creates a container that listens to requests over **HTTPS**. To communicate with the Elasticsearch instance, developers must create a `ElasticsearchClientSettings` instance and set the `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` delegate to `CertificateValidations.AllowAll`. Failing to do so will result in a communication failure as the .NET will reject the certificate coming from the container.
