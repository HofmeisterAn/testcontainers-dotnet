# Testcontainers for .NET WeatherForecast example

This example builds and ships a Blazor application in a Docker image build, runs a Docker container and executes tests against a running instance of the application. Testcontainers for .NET takes care of the Docker image build and the Docker container that hosts the application. Spin up as much as containers as you like and run your tests heavily in parallel.
